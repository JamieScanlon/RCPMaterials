# RCPMaterials
## Reality Composer Pro Dynamic Materials Library.
Reality Composer Pro has the ability to use a nodal shader graph to create dynamic procedural materials. 
The implementation is based on MaterialX but currently the application only exposes a basic set of nodes 
to work with and importing complex materials from programs like Houdini are not yet supported.

This `usd` file contains a number of primatives that can be used as building blocks to create your own
dynamic textures

Development is ongoing and contributions are welcome.
